//Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.
// JavaScript uses reserved keyword var,let,const to declare a variable.A variable must have a unique name.You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it. 

//Right Variable Declaration & Initialization
var a =1;
let b =2;
const c =3;
var d = "zahid";
var _zahid = 28;
let one1 = 1;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
console.log(d);


// Wrong Variable Declaration & Initialization
var -zahid =28;
let zahid-hasan=28;
var 1one =1;

// Multiple Variables in a Single Line
var one =1, two=2,there;
